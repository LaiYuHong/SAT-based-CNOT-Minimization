We implement SAT-based rewriting for Clifford+$T$ circuits to reduce CNOT count while preserving the non-Clifford phase content (in particular the $T/T^\dagger$ count). Following~\cite{meuli_sat_cnot}, each $\{\mathrm{CNOT},T\}$-type block is represented by an invertible linear map over $\GF(2)$ together with a phase polynomial over $\Z_8$. We encode the corresponding decision problem (HasCNOT) into Z3 and apply iterative deepening on the CNOT budget $K$ to obtain a CNOT-minimal rewrite for each block. On the LowTCount benchmark set, baseline partitioning achieves $11.3\%$ average CNOT reduction, while a DAG-based partition improves to $14.5\%$ but with much larger runtime variability.
